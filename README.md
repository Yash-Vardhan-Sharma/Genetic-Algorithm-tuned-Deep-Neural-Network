# Genetic Algorithm tuned Deep Neural Network
 Using Genetic Algorithm to optimize the weights in a deep neural network


This program aims to train a neural network for classification, on MNIST dataset.


GA-parameters


Size of population - 20

Number of generations - 1000

Mutation probability - 0.1%

Crossover type - realsbx



Neural Network architecture

Input layer - 200

Hidden layer 1 - 150

Hidden layer 2 - 60

Output layer - 10



Result
The Neural Network reaches 60% training accuracy in about 600 generations, which is a very good
result considering the initial population size is just 20.

If the population size is increased to about 100, we may get close to 90% training accuracy.
